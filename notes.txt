Notes
======
Currently our application flows down Router => App => AuthetnicationHOC(Resrouces)

We need to programatically get Router to navigate the user if isLoggedIn = True/False.
We use 'context' to get a reference.

Props go from parent to child passed down.
Context allows you to reach any compoent. So for example our Resrouces can directly access Router.

We need to define our context types we have to setup the type:

static contextTypes = {
    router: React.PropTypes.object
}

We could now do something like this.context.router.push('/'); within that component so we have access to all the router methods.
